# EndNote

[EndNote](https://endnote.com/) is a reference management tool, which can be used to organize your citations.

## Set Up Database

Note: only need to do this once.

1. Open EndNote
2. Copy the shared database from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20592661/neuropoly/endnote/NeuroPoly.enlp.zip) to your home folder \(e.g., under Document/endnote/\).
3. Open the copied database under EndNote.

2. Select a database \([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) recommended\)
3. Type keywords, then search
4. Right-click on the reference, then select “copy reference to NeuroPoly”

From Papers2:

1. In Papers, select the reference \(it should have been “matched” already\)
2. press cmd+o, then save somewhere

I have made/obtained a collection of styles for neuroimaging journals [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20592661/neuropoly/endnote/endnote_styles.zip).

## Bugs <a id="bugs"></a>

### Citation in a footnote like don't appear like in the text <a id="citation_in_footnote_like_don_t_appear_like_in_the_text"></a>

To change this so that citations in footnotes have the same format as references in the bibliography, in EndNote click on Edit, Output Styles, Edit “\[your style\]”, Footnotes Templates. Change Format citations in footnotes from Same as In-Text Citations to Same as Bibliography.

### Endnote bar disappeared on Microsoft Word <a id="endnote_bar_disappeared_on_microsoft_word"></a>

Possible solutions:

* Run disk utility &gt; Repair

### EndNote is slow <a id="endnote_is_slow"></a>

Try to “compress the library” as enx, then close EndNote, move your old library in an “old” folder \(just in case…\), then import the new compressed library. EndNote will reindex all entries, and it should then be faster.
