## Useful information

### How to pay a participant?

* Have the participant fill [this compensation form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJw3trkPCvQSfN9paHt5WmiatLp8jmCI/view?usp=sharing) \(the editable document is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b9O_sCaBzGxk97TPMjdBlS7biZnwC7Dl)\).
* Pay the participant via _Interac_ transfer or cash, or ask Alexandru Foias to do the payment. The person doing the payment will have to complete the compensation form.
* The person doing the payment can be reimbursed by sending the compensation form to `dge.sec-biomedical@polymtl.ca`. Note that you can ask to be reimbursed multiple payments at once \(more time efficient\).
